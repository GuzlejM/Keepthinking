Keepthinking Landing Page as technical test - https://keepthinking.vercel.app/

Usage:

- git clone <repoURL>
- open the folder
- npm install 
- To start the localserver
- type into command line "ember s"  -> This will start local server on http://localhost:4200/
- Or just visit https://keepthinking.vercel.app/

Technologies I have used:

- Ember.js - JS framework -> Perfect performance, modularity.
- TailwindCSS - CSS framework -> Lightweight, Very handy for responsivity.
- Git - version control 
- Github - for sharing the code with you
- Font awesome - Icons
- Hosted by Vercel
- Pictures are used from unsplash.com

I decided to use this technologies because i was working with them the most in recent projects and are fun.

I have been following instructions in the email:

I have -
- used any CSS/JS libs/frameworks
- I couldn't find needed Icons on https://linearicons.com/free I have used Fontawesome instead
- used Youtube video
- built it responsive for laptop, tabled and mobile
- didn't use Bootstrap
- been following Semantic HTML5
- did Carousel but as I'm not sure how time limited is testing process. 
  I didn't implement expanding searchbar or opening menu. If needed I'm happy to deliver after your reviewing.

I enjoyed this challenge and will be Happy to hearing from you.
